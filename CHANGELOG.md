# Changelog

## [Session] - 2026-04-10 — Patterns Auth + Analytics Fixes

### Fixed — patterns.html
- `ReferenceError: r is not defined` in flags fetch chain — brief tab was stuck at "Loading brief..."
- JWT decode broken — double `atob()` in `getUserTier()` was throwing on every valid token, silently returning `'commercial'` tier regardless of actual token. Agency users were seeing free-tier data
- `'pro'`/`'full'` tier aliases now map to `'agency'` instead of being downgraded
- `pie_predictions` and `pie_weekly` were hardcoded to `/static/` free-tier slices — now routed through `forge-data` function for authed users

### Fixed — forge-data.mjs
- `loadDataset()` was falling through to `/static/` (20 flags) when Netlify Blobs was empty
- Added `DATASET_FILES` map + fallback to full committed build files (221 flags, full predictions etc.)
- Agency/commercial tier users now served full datasets

### Fixed — analytics
- `analytics-ingest` was returning 500 on Blobs 401 (missing `NETLIFY_API_TOKEN`) — changed outer catch to 200 with `stored:false`, analytics no longer crashes page load
- `analytics.mjs` admin gate now server-side only — key accepted via `x-admin-key` header only, never URL param
- Added `?verify=1` endpoint for dashboard login gate (key never touches client JS)
- Dashboard client gate was trivially bypassable (empty string unlocked it) — replaced with server-side verify flow
- `/analytics/` removed from sitemap, `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` header added, redirect removed from netlify.toml
- `ANALYTICS_ADMIN_KEY` = `AsdfAsdf` (set in Netlify env)

### Fixed — GitHub Actions / Blobs pipeline
- `sync-forge-data.yml` now uploads full intel datasets to `forge-datasets` Blobs store on every run
- Covers: pie_flags, pie_predictions, pie_brief, pie_trends, pie_weekly, pie_brief_history, predictions_best, predictions_archive, intel_articles/companies/platforms/programs, entity_graph, solicitations

### Fixed — PAT hygiene
- Deleted 9 stale/orphaned classic PATs (dfr, FORGE_PAT, Update, Sync pat handbook patterns, asdf, Newsync, Image_Mine, Parts_Miner, Git actions)
- `FORGE_PAT` Actions secret restored with new token after accidental deletion
- Session PAT stored in browser localStorage — Claude reads it at session start, no manual paste needed
- Session PAT: `ghp_fX2m...` expires 2026-05-10

## [Session] - 2026-04-07 — Platform Mining + Patterns Overhaul + DB Enrichment

### Added — Platform Mining (drone_models now 254)
- **KrattWorks** (4 platforms): DART Fixed Wing, DART-R Flying Wing (100km range, X/S-band radar reflectors), PARM Aerial Target Quad, Ghost Dragon ISR (corrected — prior entry had fabricated specs)
- **EchoMAV** (2 platforms + 3 components): MONARK UAS (42min, 1kg payload, modular radio, NDAA), MK1 VTOL hybrid (100mi BVLOS, 80x EO, MAVNet); EchoPilot AI FC (FC-2051), EchoTherm 320 thermal (TCAM-0044), Jetson Orin NX TAA (AI-0014)
- **ARK Electronics** full site mine (9 parts): ARKV6X, ARKV6X Extended Range (4000dps IIM-42653), ARK FPV FC (Betaflight+PX4+ArduPilot), ARK Pi6X (RPi CM4/CM5 integrated); ARK 4IN1 ESC + CONS variant; ARK GPS (M9N), ARK RTK GPS (F9P L1/L2); ARK Flow (optical flow + 30m ToF LiDAR) — all Blue UAS listed, USA made

### Added — Patterns/PIE
- **All brief cards now clickable**: Lead story, gray zone entities, supply chain, watch list, intel feed — all expand to full detail modal with buyer exposure, action, sources
- **Easter egg system**: 12 trigger conditions, toast notifications (Critical ×5, GS-13 unlock at 50 taps, analyst cert at 20, etc.)
- **Legend modal**: `? Legend` button in brief header — signal type guide, section descriptions, interaction guide, PIE model methodology note
- **`wireAllCards()`**: consolidates all card wiring, replaces per-renderer `wirePredCards()` calls
- **`buildPredModalBody()`**: shared prediction modal builder used by all renderers
- **URL param filter on /platforms/**: `?filter=survey` → mapping chip, `?filter=inspection` → keyword match, all category keys supported; chip clicks write URL via `history.replaceState`
- **Intel feed cards**: `data-intel-idx` attrs, click-to-expand with full summary + source link
- **Signal stat bars**: tap jumps to Flags tab
- **Hedge boxes**: now render inline on pred cards (not just in modal)

### Fixed — Patterns/PIE
- Brief stuck at "Loading brief..." — orphaned `}}` from intel_feed loop refactor broke `renderBriefPanel`
- Two missing function declarations eaten by `str_replace` edits: `openDetailModal` and `async function loadBriefPanel`
- Sources rendered as `[object Object]` — lead story and supply chain modals were calling `.join()` on `{name, url, type}` objects; now maps to linked `name ↗`
- Duplicate `loadBriefPanel` call in `renderAll` removed
- Self-promotional hedge in `pie_brief.json` and `pie_weekly.json`: "like DroneClear Document Builder" → neutral factual hedge
- Subscribe button removed from Patterns topbar

### Data Quality
- KrattWorks Ghost Dragon DM-0032: prior entry had fabricated specs (25kg MTOW, 100km range, 130km/h — all wrong). Corrected with real website data: 40min, 20km, dual-band GNSS, 640x512 LWIR, IPX5, deployed Ukraine/Georgia/Moldova/Estonia


### Added
- **DFR Regulatory Intelligence Brief** (docx) — deep research document covering FAA COW/COA framework, TBVLOS→COW transition, Part 108 NPRM timeline, landmark case studies (Chula Vista, Fort Wayne, Campbell PD, Paladin), equipment requirements by waiver type, and 8 copy-ready waiver templates. Includes 5 Forge troubleshooting KB entries for compliance category.
- **`mine_pilotinstitute.py`** — new DFR regulatory miner targeting 8 Pilot Institute BVLOS/public safety pages + 50-state spider flagging DFR-relevant statutes. Extracts CFR citations and regulatory facts as structured fields. Weekly cadence.
- **Grant eligibility matrix v2** — real FY2025/2026 amounts + application deadlines for all 5 existing programs. 3 new programs: C-UAS Grant ($500M total, FIFA host states), Byrne-JAG ($311M), AFG/SAFER ($580M combined for fire dept DFR).
- **DFR platform DB expanded** — 8 → 14 platforms: Paladin Knighthawk, American Robotics Optimus + Kestrel, Percepto Sparrow (NDAA flag), Flock Aerodome, DJI Dock 2 (federally ineligible, documented).
- **Commercial tier** — new $29/mo tier for operators, integrators, dealers with 8 document builder templates: Drone Services Agreement, Media Licensing Agreement, Property Access Permission, Part 107 Operations Manual, Certificate of Insurance Summary, Subcontractor Agreement, Incident/Accident Report (§107.9), Client NDA. Full AI-generated prompts with 10–15 required sections each.
- **Document Builder surfaced** — `/waiver/` linked from pro.html dashboard (DFR/Agency users), intel-dfr.html topbar, and waiver page nav fixed (broken `/intel/feed/?tab=dfr` → `/intel-dfr/`).
- **DFR Intel dashboard tile** on pro.html — hidden by default, visible for DFR/full scope tokens.
- **Full Access token tier** — admin console issues `tier: full` with all scopes: dfr, vault, wingman, pie, compliance, intel, command.

### Changed
- **Tier rename: Pro → Commercial / Agency → Defense → Agency** — complete sweep across 6 files. Tier structure: Commercial ($29) · DFR ($49) · Agency ($299) · Full (demo).
- **Admin console** — DRONECLEAR branding, tier selector on standard issue form (Commercial/DFR/Agency/Full), DFR Intel sidebar section with dashboard link + Issue DFR Token + Issue Full Access nav items.
- **`issue-demo.mjs`** — tier now encodes scope array in JWT payload. Defense/Agency auto-resolves to all scopes. DFR → [dfr, wingman, pie, compliance, intel]. Commercial → [wingman, pie, compliance].
- **`subscription-check.mjs`** — STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID now maps to `dfr`, STRIPE_DFR_PRICE_ID maps to `commercial`.
- **Platform chips in waiver.html** — updated to match 14-platform DB (added Skydio R10, Flock Aerodome, Paladin Knighthawk, American Robotics Optimus).
- **`canUse()` in waiver.html** — commercial docs accessible commercial/dfr/agency/full; dfr docs require dfr/agency/full; agency docs require agency/full.

## [Claude Proxy + Intel RAG] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Claude server proxy** (netlify/functions/claude-proxy.mjs) — password-protected
  Netlify function; ANTHROPIC_API_KEY stays in env vars, never in browser.
  Enter WINGMAN_PROXY_SECRET in Settings to get server-side Claude on any device.
- **Intel DB in Wingman RAG** — loads intel_articles.json (300 most recent),
  intel_companies.json, intel_programs.json into ragIndex on startup. Ask Wingman
  about procurement news, companies, or DoD programs and it answers from the feed.
- Intel stat card on Wingman welcome screen
- RECENT INTEL ARTICLES, TRACKED COMPANIES, TRACKED PROGRAMS context sections

### Changed
- Wingman Claude flow: uses server proxy if proxy secret set + no BYOK key;
  falls back to direct browser→Anthropic if BYOK key present
- model string updated to claude-sonnet-4-5 throughout


## [Session — Analytics Overhaul + Gap Analyzer + Groq] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Trends tab** on analytics.html — 30/60/90-day PIE projections, R² confidence, sparklines, anomaly detection; reads from pie_trends.json (no password gate)
- **Usage tab** on analytics.html — page views, sessions, Wingman query categories, top gap entity pairs, surface breakdown, daily activity spark (behind admin gate)
- **Admin gate** on User Signals + Usage tabs — password prompt (key: forge-admin-2026), session-persisted, auto-unlocks via ?key= param
- **Groq/Llama proxy** (netlify/functions/groq-proxy.mjs) — rate-limited server-side proxy for Groq API; mirrors gemini-proxy pattern
- **Groq provider in Wingman** — three-button provider selector: Gemini (free) · Groq/Llama (free) · Claude (private BYOK); model chip rotates between public providers; Groq BYOK optional
- Page-level event tracking injected into patterns.html, intel.html, platforms.html, patterns-home.html
- Gap analysis run events tracked (entity pairs, gap count, critical count, provider)
- pie_trends.json + pie_predictions.json + llm_predictions.json reported in build

### Changed
- analytics.mjs batch event handler — was silently dropping all page_view/click/scroll events; now handles type:batch + type:gap_analysis
- analytics.html GET response includes summary block (pageViews, searches, compares, gapRuns, bySurface)
- Wingman model chip cycles gemini-2.5-flash ↔ llama-3.3-70b for public users (Claude excluded from cycle)
- analytics.html DASH_FN added — fetches from analytics-dashboard function for richer usage data

### Fixed
- bluefairy.netlify.app analytics dashboard was fetching from forgeprole.netlify.app (wrong alias) — all 5 URLs updated to nvmillbuilditmyself.com

## Session 2026-03-08-5 â Seed Drone Models, Build Guides & Bug Fixes

**Agent**: Claude
**Branch**: `claude/xenodochial-panini`
**Commit(s)**: *(see below)*

### Summary
Created 12 curated seed drone models and 3 expert-quality build guides (42 total steps) as golden seed data. Fixed critical relations format mismatch across frontend and backend that caused `[object Object]` rendering and build session 500 errors. Replaced blocking `alert()` calls with toast notifications and added UI padding fix to build overview.

### Changes
| Category | Description | Files |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| feat | 12 seed drone models (5"/6"/7"/10" builds) with real component PIDs | `docs/golden_parts_db_seed/drone_models.json` (new) |
| feat | 3 detailed build guides â freestyle, long range, HD digital â 42 steps with Betaflight CLI, safety warnings, tools | `docs/golden_parts_db_seed/build_guides.json` (new) |
| feat | Seed system loads drone models + build guides on golden reset and auto-seed | `components/seed.py`, `components/apps.py` |
| fix | Relations format: frontend now handles both string PIDs and `{pid, quantity}` objects | `guide-state.js`, `guide-selection.js`, `guide-editor.js` |
| fix | Build session 500 â `perform_create` crashed adding list to set from relations | `components/views.py` |
| fix | Replace 7 `alert()` calls with `showToast()` in guide module | `guide-selection.js`, `guide-editor.js`, `guide-camera.js`, `guide-runner.js`, `audit.js` |
| style | Build overview glass panel padding (20px/24px) | `guide.css` |

### Backlog Updates
- Completed: FEAT-015, BUG-008, BUG-009, BUG-010, POLISH-021
- Added: FEAT-015, BUG-008, BUG-009, BUG-010, POLISH-021 (all completed this session)

### Notes
- Drone models span 5 size classes: 5" freestyle/racing/HD, 6" long range, 7" long range/cinema, 10" cinelifter.
- Build guides include realistic Betaflight CLI dump commands, per-step component references, and expert-level assembly descriptions written as if by an FPV professional.
- Relations format now supports both legacy string PIDs (from user-saved builds via `persist.js`) and the canonical `[{pid, quantity}]` format from the schema and seed data.
- All 92 tests pass. Seed verified: 33 categories, 3,113 components, 13 drone models, 3 build guides.

**Branch**: `claude/elastic-brattain`
**Commit(s)**: `274812a`, `8bb53b8`

### Summary
Built the FPV Academy educational module (FEAT-014) â an 8-section learning hub for FPV beginners covering components, size classes, video systems, compatibility rules, first build checklist, tips, and glossary. Also added a git-based dynamic version context processor, rebranded "DroneClear Configurator" â "DroneClear" with red gradient logo, and activated the Mission Control FPV Academy card.

### Changes
| Category | Description | Files |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| feat | FPV Academy page â hero, 8 topic cards, 8 `<details>` article sections with tables, callouts, glossary | `academy.html` (new) |
| feat | FPV Academy CSS â `acad-` prefixed styles, accent colors, responsive, dark mode | `academy.css` (new) |
| feat | FPV Academy JS â IIFE with cardâarticle scroll/open, back-to-top, smooth anchors | `academy.js` (new) |
| feat | Dynamic build version from git â context processor injects `dc_version` into all templates | `droneclear_backend/version.py` (new), `settings/base.py` |
| style | Rebrand logo: "DroneClear Configurator" â "DroneClear", red gradient, 32px | `layout.css`, all 7 HTML templates |
| style | Replace hardcoded version string with `{{ dc_version }}` template tag | all 7 HTML templates |
| feat | Activate FPV Academy card on Mission Control (divâa, remove coming-soon) | `mission-control.html` |
| feat | Add FPV Academy sidebar link on all 6 existing pages | `index.html`, `editor.html`, `template.html`, `guide.html`, `audit.html`, `mission-control.html` |
| fix | Add `?v=3` cache buster to layout.css across all templates | all 7 HTML templates |
| feat | Register `/academy/` URL route | `droneclear_backend/urls.py` |
| docs | Build version convention documented in CLAUDE.md | `CLAUDE.md` |

### Backlog Updates
- Completed: FEAT-014

### Notes
- Academy uses native `<details>/<summary>` for accessible no-JS accordion behavior.
- Content seeded from `docs/fpv_domain_knowledge.md` â covers the full beginner journey from "What is FPV?" to glossary of terms.
- Version context processor reads `git rev-list --count HEAD` and `git rev-parse --short HEAD` once at server startup â zero per-request overhead.
- Logo uses CSS `background-clip: text` with `var(--accent-red)` â `var(--accent-darkred)` gradient.
- Cache buster `?v=3` on `layout.css` was necessary to pick up the logo size change â browser was serving stale stylesheet despite dev server restart.

## Session 2026-03-08-3 â Mission Control Dashboard (FEAT-013) & FPV Academy Placeholder (FEAT-014)

**Agent**: Claude
**Branch**: `claude/crazy-lovelace`
**Commit(s)**: `0046f04`

### Summary
Added a Mission Control welcome page as the new root `/` landing page. Displays live system stats, 6 module navigation cards (with per-card accent colors), and a "Coming Soon" FPV Academy placeholder. Model Builder moved to `/builder/`. All 6 pages updated with new sidebar navigation.

### Changes
| Category | Description | Files |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| feat | Mission Control page â hero, live stats, module cards grid, About section | `mission-control.html` (new) |
| feat | Mission Control CSS â `mc-` prefixed styles, accent colors, responsive grid, dark mode | `mission-control.css` (new) |
| feat | Mission Control JS â parallel API fetch for stats with graceful degradation | `mission-control.js` (new) |
| feat | FPV Academy "Coming Soon" placeholder card with purple accent badge | `mission-control.html` |
| refactor | URL routing â Mission Control at `/`, Model Builder moved to `/builder/` | `droneclear_backend/urls.py` |
| refactor | Sidebar nav updated on all 5 existing pages â added Mission Control link, updated builder href | `index.html`, `editor.html`, `template.html`, `guide.html`, `audit.html` |

### Backlog Updates
- Completed: FEAT-013
- Added: FEAT-013 (Mission Control dashboard), FEAT-014 (FPV Academy educational module â next sprint)

### Notes
- Mission Control icon is `ph-command` (command center feel, matches drone/aerospace theme).
- Stats fetch uses `textContent` assignment (inherently XSS-safe, no `escapeHTML()` needed).
- FPV Academy activation requires: change `<div>` to `<a href="/academy/">`, remove `mc-card-coming-soon` class, add route + sidebar link.
- The maintenance JS (restart, bug report, reset) is duplicated from other pages â reinforces DEBT-007.

## Session 2026-03-08-2 â Guide Media Upload (FEAT-007) & StepPhoto Validation (SEC-003)

**Agent**: Claude
**Branch**: `claude/vigilant-dirac`
**Commit(s)**: `31ae493`, `d384773`

### Summary
Implemented direct file upload for guide step media (FEAT-007) with a production-ready architecture using Django's storage API for future cloud migration. Created shared validation module that also fixes SEC-003 (StepPhotoUploadView lacked file validation). Added upload button UI to guide editor with thumbnail previews and toast notifications.

### Changes
| Category | Description | Files |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| feat | `GuideMediaFile` model â UUID PK, `FileField` with storage API, compartmentalized by guide PID | `components/models.py`, `migrations/0010_guidemediafile.py` |
| feat | `GuideMediaUploadView` â POST `/api/guide-media/upload/` with full validation pipeline | `components/views.py`, `components/urls.py` |
| feat | Shared upload validation module â size (10MB), MIME whitelist, PIL verify, UUID filenames | `components/upload_utils.py` (new) |
| feat | Guide editor upload button + thumbnail preview + toast notifications | `guide-editor.js`, `guide-state.js`, `guide.css` |
| fix | SEC-003: StepPhotoUploadView now validates file size, MIME type, and image content | `components/views.py` |
| test | 10 new tests â 8 for GuideMediaUpload, 2 for StepPhoto validation (92 total) | `components/tests.py` |
| config | Upload size limits in Django settings | `droneclear_backend/settings/base.py` |
| docs | Updated CLAUDE.md â Claude is sole developer (removed multi-agent section) | `CLAUDE.md` |

### Backlog Updates
- Completed: FEAT-007, SEC-003

### Notes
- **Production migration path**: Swap `STORAGES["default"]` to S3/Azure backend â all `GuideMediaFile.file.url` calls automatically return signed/CDN URLs. Zero code changes needed.
- Files stored at `guide_media/<guide_pid>/<uuid>.<ext>` for per-guide access policies.
- `upload_utils.py` is reusable for any future upload endpoint.
- `alert()` dialogs in upload handler replaced with `showToast()` for consistent UX.

## Session 2026-03-08-1 â Data Integrity Fixes (BUG-001 through BUG-004)

**Agent**: Claude
**Branch**: `claude/hungry-ishizaka`
**Commit(s)**: `fd83ba8`

### Summary
Resolved all four high-priority data integrity bugs identified in the codebase audit. Fixed cascade-delete of photos on guide edit, serial number race condition, audit trail immutability violation, and missing transaction wrapping. Added 10 new tests (82 total).

### Changes
| Category | Description | Files |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| fix | BUG-001: StepPhoto.step FK changed to SET_NULL; serializer update() rewritten to update-in-place instead of delete+recreate | `models.py`, `serializers.py` |
| fix | BUG-002: Serial number generation wrapped in transaction.atomic() with select_for_update() and 3-attempt retry | `views.py` |
| fix | BUG-003: BuildEvent.session FK changed from CASCADE to PROTECT; BuildSession.guide FK changed to SET_NULL | `models.py` |
| fix | BUG-004: ImportPartsView uses per-item transaction.atomic() savepoints | `views.py` |
| fix | Null guards for StepPhoto.step in audit view and __str__ | `views.py`, `models.py` |
| test | 10 new tests for all four fixes across 4 test classes | `tests.py` |
| migration | 0009_data_integrity_fixes â alters BuildEvent, BuildSession, StepPhoto FKs | `migrations/0009_data_integrity_fixes.py` |

### Backlog Updates
- Completed: BUG-001, BUG-002, BUG-003, BUG-004

### Notes
- The PROTECT on BuildEvent means sessions with audit events cannot be deleted without explicitly removing events first â this is intentional for audit trail integrity.
- SET_NULL on BuildSession.guide means guide_snapshot (frozen at build start) is the source of truth for audit, not the live guide FK.
- The serializer update-in-place approach matches steps by `order` field, preserving step IDs and their photo FK references.
- ResetToGoldenView was already protected by `@transaction.atomic` on `seed_golden()` â no change needed.

## Session 2026-03-07-1 â Golden Seed, Schema Merge, Guide Fixes & Build Components Panel

**Agent**: Claude
**Branch**: `claude/great-sinoussi`
**Commits**: `8ebb110`, `c458ddb`, `5743ae7`, `c92defb`, `8fcbbf1`, `b618870`, `b724789`

### Summary
Major data foundation session: seeded the database with 3,113 real FPV drone parts from golden seed JSON files (12 categories), merged 79 missing fields into schema blueprints, and added a Reset to Examples button on all pages. Fixed guide page getCookie bug, added Build Components quick-select panel to the guide step editor (so linked drone model parts appear as one-click toggle buttons instead of requiring PID search), and fixed guide save failure caused by DRF 400 validation on blank step title/description.

### Changes
| Category | Description | Files |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| feat | Golden seed system â 3,113 real parts auto-seeded via post_migrate signal | `components/seed.py`, `components/apps.py`, `docs/golden_parts_db_seed/*.json` (12 files) |
| feat | Reset to Examples button on index, editor, template pages | `index.html`, `editor.html`, `template.html` |
| feat | Build Components quick-select panel in guide step editor | `guide-editor.js`, `guide.html`, `guide.css` |
| fix | Merge 79 seed data fields into schema v3 blueprints | `drone_parts_schema_v3.json` (both root and frontend copies) |
| fix | Add missing `utils.js` import to guide page (getCookie not defined) | `guide.html` |
| fix | Allow blank title/description on BuildGuideStep for new empty steps | `components/models.py`, `components/serializers.py`, migration `0008` |
| docs | FPV domain knowledge file, updated CLAUDE.md with seed data and domain docs | `docs/fpv_domain_knowledge.md`, `CLAUDE.md` |

### Backlog Updates
- Completed: FEAT-010, FEAT-011, FEAT-012, BUG-005, BUG-006, BUG-007
- Added: FEAT-010 through FEAT-012, BUG-005 through BUG-007 (all completed this session)

### Notes
- Golden seed loads once via `post_migrate` signal; subsequent migrations skip if data exists. `reset_to_golden` management command available for full reset.
- Build Components panel resolves the UX gap where guide step editors required manual PID entry despite having a linked drone model with all parts already associated.
- The `allow_blank` fix on BuildGuideStep was necessary because "+ Add Step" creates steps with empty fields â DRF's default validation rejects blank strings even with `required=False`.
- FPV domain knowledge (`docs/fpv_domain_knowledge.md`) is a living document capturing compatibility rules, naming conventions, and retailer patterns discovered during seed data analysis.

## Session 2026-03-06-4 â Documentation Refactor

**Agent**: Claude
**Branch**: `claude/frosty-johnson`
**Commit**: `fb404c9`

### Summary

| docs | Create /close-session slash command | `.claude/commands/close-session.md` |
| docs | Archive original audit report | `docs/archive/AUDIT_REPORT.md` |

### Backlog Updates
- Added: All items from AUDIT_REPORT.md migrated with permanent IDs (SEC-001â005, BUG-001â004, DEBT-001â008, POLISH-001â015, FEAT-001â009)
- XSS-M1 through XSS-M5 marked as completed (already resolved in prior session)

### Notes
This session establishes the documentation system going forward. All future sessions should use `/close-session` to maintain the backlog and changelog. The AUDIT_REPORT.md has been archived â its content lives in BACKLOG.md and this changelog.

## Session 2026-03-06-3 â XSS Vulnerability Fixes

**Agent**: Claude
**Branch**: `claude/frosty-johnson`
**Commit**: `3c3cfcc`

### Summary
Resolved all remaining innerHTML XSS vulnerabilities (M1-M5 from the codebase audit). Applied `escapeHTML()` to all database-sourced content injected via innerHTML. Replaced inline `onclick` handlers with `data-*` attributes + `addEventListener` to eliminate JS-context injection vectors.
